# SpaceX-StarShip
SpaceX StarShip VR simulator

Experience the real size and behaviour of SpaceX StarShip prototypes with this VR WebXR Three.js experience.
Tested with Oculus Quest 2.

Check sample here:
https://elricdog.github.io/SpaceX-StarShip/VRStarShip/

Mainly developed to learn about Threejs, 3D, VR.
A bunch of code that will help noobs like me to start with:
- Splashscreen loading
- Mix html content with webxr
- Scene management
- Locomotion and Teletransportation
- Objects grab and select
- XR Gamepad
- Mouse interaction
- Keyboard handle
- Standard Gamepad
- Particle system helper
- Statistics in VR
- Blender
- Lens flares
- Water + Sky + Sun effect from threejs examples
- 3D UI
- Many more and more to come...

Look at license.txt files to find sources of inspiration.
Many thanks to MR.doob & co for Threejs.
